        <h1>Who is Michael Phelps!?</h1>

        <p>Michael Fred Phelps (born June 30, 1985) is an American former competitive swimmer and the most successful
            and most decorated Olympian of all time, with a total of 28 medals. Phelps also holds the all-time records
            for Olympic gold medals (23), Olympic gold medals in individual events (13), and Olympic medals in
            individual events (16). When he won eight gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Games, Phelps broke fellow
            American swimmer
            Mark Spitz' 1972 record of seven first-place finishes at any single Olympic Games. At the 2004 Summer
            Olympics in Athens, Phelps had already tied the record of eight medals of any color at a single Games by
            winning six
            gold and two bronze medals. At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Phelps won four gold and two silver
            medals, and at
            the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, he won five gold medals and one silver. This made him the most
            successful athlete of the Games for the fourth Olympics in a row.
