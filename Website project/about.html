            <h1>Beijing 2008</h1>
            <p>Another 12 titles came his way at the 2005 and 2007 FINA World Aquatics Championships, held in Montreal
                and
                Melbourne respectively, a sign of things to come at Beijing 2008, where he took gold in all eight events
                he
                contested. It was a feat unprecedented in any sport in the history of the Games.
                In topping the podium in the 100m and 200m butterfly, 200m freestyle, 200m and 400m individual medleys
                and
                the
                4x100m and 4x200m freestyle relays and the 4x100m medley relay, the voracious Phelps posted seven world
                records
                and an Olympic record in the 100m butterfly. His exploits in the Chinese capital made him the most
                decorated
                of
                all Olympians with 14 gold medals.</p>

            <p>Phelps confirmed that he was retiring following the 2016 Summer Olympics.

                "I've been able to do everything I've ever put my mind to in this sport. And 24 years in the
                sport.
                I'm
                happy with how things finished," he said. "I'm ready to retire. I'm happy about it. I'm in a
                better
                state of
                mind this time than I was four years ago."
